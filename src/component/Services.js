                Customized Systems: Get what you need not what they are selling.
                Every customer is different, and every customer’s site, roof or
                building is different. At MSI Enterprices, we start by listening
                carefully to the customer’s unique needs and concerns. Then we
                perform a thorough site survey. We use the latest software and
                tools to measure shading, solar irradiance and azimuths, and we
                analyze the building’s electrical systems and structural
                elements.

                We get asked a frequently, “how do you deliver a high quality
                product, with great service, at a low price?” Sounds like
                marketing hype, we know. But there’s plenty of science and hard
                work behind it. The founders of MSI Enterprices spent many years
                in the high speed, high stakes world of large commercial
                construction project management and learning and perfecting some
                of the most sophisticated cost and quality control systems and
                methodologies that industry has to offer.
